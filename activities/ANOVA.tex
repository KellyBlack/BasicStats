\actTitle{Analysis of Variance}

The American Society of Hand Therapists has a set of guidelines and
tables associated with grip strength. A group of hand therapists run
an experiment to see how their own patients compare with each
other. They choose a group of patients at random and measure their
grip strength using a dynamometer. 

They obtain the following results for strength in their patient's
left hands: \\
\begin{tabular}{lll@{\hspace{4em}}lll}
Age Range & Sex & Force (lb.) & Age Range & Sex & Force (lb.) \\
40-44 & F & 89.8 & 20-24 & F & 63.5 \\
30-34 & M & 57.7 & 20-24 & M & 118.9 \\
40-44 & F & 39.2 & 40-44 & M & 105.3 \\
20-24 & F & 66.0 & 30-34 & F & 66.2 \\
30-34 & M & 87.4 & 20-24 & F & 72.6 \\
40-44 & F & 67.9 & 30-34 & M & 75.5 \\
40-44 & F & 53.0 & 40-44 & M & 106.2 \\
40-44 & F & 56.2 & 20-24 & M & 52.3 \\
40-44 & F & 83.6 & 30-34 & M & 98.8
\end{tabular}

\begin{problem}
  \item Organize and collect the data into two groups, male and
    female. 
    \vfill

  \item Determine the numbers of degrees of freedom for the male and
    female groups as well as the total.

    \vspace{5em}

  \item The staff at the practice believe that there is a difference
    in the grip strengths for the left hand based on the patient's
    sex. State the hypothesis test that they will use.

  \item Determine the values for the sum of the squares, SSTr, SST,
    and SSE.  Verify that SST = SSTr + SSE.

    \vfill

  \item Fill in the analysis of variance table. 

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline
      Source & df & Sum of Squares & Mean Squares & F-statistic & $p$-value \\ \hline
      Treatments & & & & & \\ \hline
      Error & & & & &  \\ \hline
      Total & & & & &  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

  \item State the conclusion for your hypothesis test.

  \item Repeat the previous analysis but use the three different age groups instead.
