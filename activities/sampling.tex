\actTitle{The Sampling Distribution} 

\begin{problem}
  \item Suppose you flip a coin. What is the probability you get a
    tail? Work together with your class to estimate this probability.
    \begin{subproblem}
    \item Everybody flip a coin once. Determine the sample proportion
      for getting a tail.
      \vfill
    \item Everybody flip a coin one more time. Determine the sample proportion
      for getting a tail.
      \vfill
    \item Everybody flip a coin one more time. Determine the sample proportion
      for getting a tail.
      \vfill
    \item Compare the estimates. Are they all the same? Repeat the
      experiments above but instead have everybody flip the coin
      twice. What is the difference?
