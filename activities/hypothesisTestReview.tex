Survey of Hypothesis Testing

\begin{enumerate}
\item A new procedure is tested for patients recovering from knee
  replacement surgery. Currently patients have a mean range of motion
  of ninety degrees after four weeks. A randomly chosen group of
  twenty-three patients take part in a new therapy schedule. Four
  weeks after their surgery the sample mean for the range of motion is
  ninety-three degrees with a sample standard deviation of nine
  degrees. Did the new schedule increase the range of motion?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the appropriate distribution? 
  \item Organize the relevant information: \\ [30pt]
  \item State the hypothesis test: \\ [20pt]
  \item Determine whether or not you can reject the null hypotheis:
    \vfill
  \item Provide a formal statement of your conclusion: 
  \end{enumerate}

\item A new procedure is tested for patients recovering from knee
  replacement surgery. The standard of care is to determine whether or
  not a patient's range of motion exceeds ninety degrees four weeks
  after their surgery, and currently sixty-five percent of all
  patients meet that standard of care. A randomly chosen group of
  fifty-eight patients take part in a new therapy schedule. Four weeks
  after their surgery forty-four of the patients had a range of motion
  greater than ninety degrees. Did the new schedule increase the range
  of motion?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the appropriate distribution? 
  \item Organize the relevant information: \\ [30pt]
  \item State the hypothesis test: \\ [20pt]
  \item Determine whether or not you can reject the null hypotheis:
    \vfill
  \item Provide a formal statement of your conclusion:

\item A new procedure will be tested for patients recovering from knee
  replacement surgery. Currently patients have a mean range of motion
  of ninety degrees after four weeks with a standard deviation of nine
  degrees. A randomly chosen group of patients will take part in a new
  therapy schedule. How many patients will be required to take part in
  the study if we wish to reject the null hypothesis if the error in
  the means is more than three degrees?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the appropriate distribution? 
  \item Organize the relevant information: \\ [30pt]
  \item State the hypothesis test: \\ [20pt]
  \item Determine the required number of patients.
