Bivariate data

The opening values for the DOW are given below as well as the opening
prices for stocks in Eli Lilly.

\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
  Date & DOW & Eli Lilly \\ \hline
  2010-01-04 & 28.20 & 35.77 \\
  2011-01-03 & 34.49 & 35.17 \\
  2012-01-03 & 29.28 & 41.95 \\
  2013-01-02 & 32.99 & 49.94 \\
  2014-01-02 & 44.20 & 50.97
\end{tabular}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Your colleague wants to know if the DOW is a good predictor for
  the price of Eli Lilly stocks.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Make a sketch of the scatter plot with the $x$ variable being
    the value of the DOW, and the $y$ variable is the price of an Eli
    Lilly stock. State whether or not you think there is a positive or
    negative relationship.
    \vfill
  \item Determine the sample correlation between the value of the DOW
    and the value of a stock in Eli Lilly. 
    \vfill
  \item Determine if there is a relationship between the two values
    based on the correlation using a 95\% confidence level.
    \vfill
  \item Do you think it is appropriate to perform a linear regression
    on these two variables?
  \end{enumerate}

\clearpage

\item Suppose that your colleague insists that the data should have a
  relationship and asks you to perform linear regression. Use the
  table on the previous page to answer each of the questions below.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine estimates for the slope and intercept using linear
    regression. 
    \vfill
  \item Determine the 95\% confidence level for the slope.
    \vfill
  \item Determine if there is a relationship between the two values
    based on the slope using a 95\% confidence level.
    \vfill
  \item Do you think it is appropriate to perform a linear regression
    on these two variables?
  \end{enumerate}

\clearpage

\item The mean red blood cell counts for patients can decrease after
  radiation treatment. The weeks after treatment and mean blood cell
  count (in millions of cells per micro-litre) are given below.

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Week & Red Blood Cell Count \\ \hline
  1 & 4.10 \\
  2 & 4.08 \\
  3 & 4.18 \\
  4 & 4.38
\end{tabular}

Your colleague wants to know if there is a relationship between the
time after treatment and the red blood cell count.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Make a sketch of the scatter plot with the $x$ variable being
    the number of weeks after treatment, and the $y$ variable is the
    red blood cell count. State whether or not you think there is a
    positive or negative relationship.  
    \vfill

  \item Determine the sample correlation between the time after
    treatment and the red blood cell count. 
    \vfill

  \item Determine if there is a relationship between the two values
    based on the correlation using a 95\% confidence level.
    \vfill

  \item Do you think it is appropriate to perform a linear regression
    on these two variables?
  \end{enumerate}
