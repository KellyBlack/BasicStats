\begin{problem}
  \item The marketing department wants to get data on the price
    elasticity of demand for tissues. A set of stores is chosen at
    random, and the prices for a four pack of tissues is set at
    different levels. The number of sales at each store are then
    measured, and the results are given below. \\
    \begin{tabular}{r|r}
      Price & Units Sold \\ \hline
      6.46\$ & 704 \\
      7.38\$ & 677 \\
      6.79\$ & 695 \\
      6.69\$ & 697 \\
      6.12\$ & 717
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{subproblem}
    \item Make a sketch of the scatter plot. State what the $x$ and
      the $y$ variables should be and why. State whether or not there
      should be a positive or negative relationship and justify your
      answer.

      \vfill

    \item Determine the sample correlation between the price and the
      number of sales.

      \vfill

    \item Determine estimates for the slope and $y$-intercept for the
      linear regression.

      \vfill

    \item Do you think it is appropriate to perform a linear
      regression on these two variables?

  \item Jeff Saruo wrote a blog
    post\footnote{\url{http://www.measuringu.com/1955.php}} in
    reaction to a book by Malcom Gladwell in which it is stated that
    the birth date for hockey players matters with respect to their
    success. Gladwell tried to replicate that analysis for
    millionaires. The argument is that there was a particular time
    that was right for rapid success in the software industry, and he
    compiled the following data set: \\
    \begin{tabular}{r|r|r|r}
      Year & Number Births & All CEO   & Software  Millionaire \\
           & (USA)         & Birthdays & Birthdays \\
      1920 & 28,582,000 &  2  &  3 \\
      1930 & 24,374,000 &  2  &  1 \\
      1940 & 31,666,000 &  23 & 10 \\
      1950 & 40,530,000 &  38 & 14 \\
      1960 & 38,808,409 &  9  &  7 \\
      1970 & 33,308,985 &  0  &  4
    \end{tabular}

    Perform an appropriate analysis of this data.

  the price of Eli Lilly stocks.

    Lilly stock. State whether or not you think there is a positive or
    negative relationship.
