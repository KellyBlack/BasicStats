 \textbf{Probability: Introduction} \\
\\
\textit{You are not expected to finish this during the class period. Anything you don't finish is good to practice at home.}  \\ [5pt]

\textbf{Definition:} \\ [5pt]

 The \textit{probability} of an outcome is the long term proportion in which the outcome is observed. \\
\\
Probabilities reveal long term predictability. \\
\\
If probability = 0, outcome is \textit{impossible}. \\
If probability is = 1, outcome is a \textit{certainty}. \\ 

\textbf{Define the following terms in your own words :} (1 or 2 sentences) \\ [5pt]
Event:\\  [12pt]
Outcome: \\ [12pt]
Experiment:\\ [12pt]
Observational Study: \\ [12pt]

 \textbf{Experiment :}

 Flip a coin 10 times and record the total sample proportion of heads each time, including the previous flips.\\

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | r |}
 \hline 
Number of Flips & Number of Heads & Sample Proportion of Heads \\  \hline 
1 &  & \\  [12pt] \hline 
2 & & \\  [12pt]  \hline 
3 & & \\ [12pt]  \hline 
4 & & \\  [12pt]  \hline 
5 & & \\  [12pt]  \hline 
\end{tabular}  
\\
Find a partner and put your data together. Describe what happens to the proportion when you have 10 flips? 20 flips? More?\\
\vspace{5em}
\\

Make a bar graph of the total frequency of heads and tails for 20 flips. \\
\vspace{10em}

\textbf{Definititon:}\\

\textit{Sample space:}  is the collection of all possible \textit{events}. \\

\textit{Venn Diagrams} and \textit{ Tree Diagrams} are ways to visualize sample space.
\\

\textbf{Practice:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item You flip a fair coin. Define the sample space of this experiment by writing down all the possible events.\\

\begin{itemize}
 \item Repeat the exercise again but for flipping a coin 2 times?\\
 \vspace{2em}
 
 \item How about 3 times? Draw a tree diagram to represent all possible events when you flip a coin 3 times.\\
\vspace{7em}

  \end{itemize}
  
\item In a class of 30 students, 10 chose \textbf{only} art as an elective, 2 chose both, 14 chose music. How many chose neither?
\textit{Draw the sample space using an appropriate diagram.}\\ 
\vspace{5em}

 \end{enumerate}

\textbf{Application:} \textit{This activity will be done as a class.} \\ [12pt]

A volunteer will pick beans out of a bag. Every time a bean is picked, record the total number of black beans picked in the middle column. (Include previous trials.) In the right column record the total sample proportion of black beans picked every time you pick another bean. \\

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | r |}
 \hline 
Number & Number of Black & Proportion of Black \\  \hline 
1 &  & \\  [12pt] \hline 
2 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
3 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
4 & & \\  [12pt]  \hline 
5 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
6 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
7 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
8 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
9 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
10 & & \\  [12pt] \hline 
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
Based on the results what is the predicted proportion of black beans? \\
