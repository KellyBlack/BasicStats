 \textbf{Probability: Counting} \\
\\
\textit{You are not expected to finish this during the class period. Anything you don't finish is good to practice at home.}  \\ [5pt]

\textbf{Please define the following terms in your own words:} (1 or 2 sentences) \\ [5pt]

  \textit{Probability:} \\
\\
\textit{Certain vs. Impossible}\\

\textbf{Definittions:}  \\ [5pt]
\textit{Counting: } Determining the number of outcomes that sequence of events could result in.  Ex: There are 3 types of cones in an ice cream store and 10 flavors therefore there are 30 different types of cone and ice cream combinations if only one cone and one flavor is chosen.\\  [12pt]

\textit{Factorial: }Used to represent the number of ways that k number of objects can be ordered. k! = k x (k-1) x (k-2) x ... x 1.  Remember 0! = 1. \\ [12pt]


 \textbf{Examples:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In how many different ways can a cross country race be completed if there are 5 runners and no ties?\\

\item If a multiple choice test has 10 questions with 5 choices for each questions in how many different ways can you complete the test?\\

\item A license plate has three letters and 3 digits. How many different license plates can be made made? \\

\item An ID number begins with a letter and is followed by 4 numbers. How many different ID numbers can be made? \\
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Definititon:}\\

\textit{Permutation:}   An ordering of a set of distinct objects.  \\  [12pt]
Notation: nPr where \textit{n} is the number of distinct objects and \tectit{r} is the number of objects taken at a time.  Order matters.\\[12pt]
Example: How many different can this set of letters be arranged if two letters are used in a group?\\[12pt]
Letter Set: ABC\\[12pt]
Possible permutations: AA, AB,  AC, BA,  BB,  BC, CA, CB,  CC\\ [12pt]

\textit{Combination:}  A combination of a a number of elements form a set where order does not matter. \\ [12pt]
Example: How many different combinations of 2 letters can be made from these 3 letters?\\ [12pt]
Letter Set: ABC\\ [12pt]
Possible combinations: AB,  AC,  BA, BC, CA, CB. \\ [12pt]
