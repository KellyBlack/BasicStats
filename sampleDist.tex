    The mass of the contents of a product are normally distributed
    with a mean of 0.35 kg and a standard deviation of 0.04 kg. What
    is the probability that one sample will be less than 0.33 kg?

\subsection{The Sample Mean}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Sample Mean}

  We have a bunch of measurements:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \bar{x} & = & x_1,~x_2,~x_3,\cdots,~x_n.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Each measurement has a mean, $\mu$, and a standard deviation of
  $\sigma$. We assume that they are all independent of one another.
  
  \only<1-2>
  {
    \begin{definition}
      Given measurements the sample mean is 
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        \bar{x} & = & \frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\cdots+x_n}{n}.
      \end{eqnarray*}
    \end{definition}
  }

  \only<3->
  {
    \begin{definition}
      Given measurements the sample mean is 
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        \bar{x} & = & \frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\cdots+x_n}{n}.
      \end{eqnarray*}
      The sample mean, $\bar{x}$,  has a mean of $\mu$, and it has a
      standard deviation of $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
    \end{definition}

    The sample mean is a random variable!

  \frametitle{Distribution of the Sample Mean}

  We have a random variable, $X$, which has mean $\mu$ and standard
  deviation $\sigma.$

  We have a collection of measurements:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \bar{x} & = & x_1,~x_2,~x_3,\cdots,~x_n.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Each measurement has a mean, $\mu$, and a standard deviation of
  $\sigma$. We assume that they are all independent of one another.
  
  Given the measurements the sample mean is
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \bar{x} & = & \frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\cdots+x_n}{n}.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  The sample mean, $\bar{x}$,  has a mean of $\mu$, and it has a
  standard deviation of $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

\subsection{Examples}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Example}

  The life time of batteries is normally distributed with a mean of
  19.8 hours and a standard deviation of 1.3 hours. What is the
  probability that a sample size of six batteries will give a sample
  mean that is more than 21.1 hours?

  \frametitle{Example}

  You want to estimate the start up costs for restaurants in an
  area. If the mean start up costs are \$235,000 with a standard
  deviation of \$45,000 what is the probability that a sample of
  twenty restaurants will be between \$260,000 and \$205,000?

  \frametitle{Example}

  You want to estimate the start up costs for restaurants in an
  area. If the mean start up costs are \$235,000 with a standard
  deviation of \$45,000 how many restaurants should you poll so that
  the probability to be within \$1,000 of the mean is eighty percent?
