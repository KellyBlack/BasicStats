\subsection{Examples}

\subsection{Cereal Box Contents}

\begin{frame}{Cereal}

  Cereal is produced at one of your factories. You are told that the
  mean contents is 417.3g per box. You suspect that this is too
  high. 

  \vfill

  \only<2->
  {
    \begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{2em}}l}
      $H_0$: & The mean is 417.3g \\
      $H_a$: & The mean is less than 417.3g 
    \end{tabular}
    \\ Use a 5\% significance level.
  }

  \vfill

  \only<3->
  {

    Sample fifteen boxes chosen at random, and ask if there is
    sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$. Suppose we find a sample mean
    of 412.4g and a standard deviation of 12.0g.

  }

  \vfill

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result}

  We \textbf{do not} have sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ at the
  5\% significance level using a normal distribution with fifteen
  samples and a standard deviation of 12.0g.
  
\end{frame}



\subsection{Stock Price Change}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Clicker Quiz}

  We read that the mean change in the price of the stocks in a given
  sector changed by -0.55\$ with a standard deviation of 0.74\$. We
  suspect that the mean change is not that low.

  What hypothesis test would you form to test this? \\
  ~ \\
  \begin{tabular}{ll@{\hspace{3em}}l}
    A & $H_0$: The mean change is -0.55\$. \\
      & $H_a$: The mean change is more than -0.55. \\
    ~ \\
    B & $H_0$: The mean change is -0.55\$. \\
      & $H_a$: The mean change is less than -0.55\$. \\
    ~ \\
    C & $H_0$: The mean change is less than -0.55\$.  \\
      & $H_a$: The mean change is -0.55\$. \\
    ~ \\
    D & $H_0$: The mean change is more than -0.55\$.  \\
      & $H_a$: The mean change is -0.55\$.

  \end{tabular}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Stock Price}

  We read that the mean change in the price of the stocks in a given
  sector changed by -0.55\$ with a standard deviation of 0.74\$. We
  suspect that the mean change is not that low.

  \vfill

  \only<2->
  {
    \begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{2em}}l}
      $H_0$: & The mean change is -0.55\$. \\
      $H_a$: & The mean change is more than -0.55. 
    \end{tabular}
    \\ Use a 5\% significance level.
  }

  \vfill

  \only<3->
  {

    Sample one-hundred stocks chosen at random, and ask if there is
    sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$. Suppose that we find a sample
    mean of -0.42\$.

  }

  \vfill

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result}

  We have sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ at the 5\% significance
  level using a normal distribution with a one-hundred samples and a
  standard deviation of 0.74\$.
  
\end{frame}


\subsection{Units Shipped}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Clicker Quiz}

  You are told that the mean number of units shipped per day at a
  particular factory is 135,000 units per day. You think that number
  is not correct.

  What hypothesis test would you form to test this? \\
  ~ \\
  \begin{tabular}{ll@{\hspace{3em}}l}
    A & $H_0$: The mean number of units is more than 135,000 units per day. \\
      & $H_a$: The mean number of units is 135,000 units per day. \\
    ~ \\
    B & $H_0$: The mean number of units is 135,000 units per day. \\
      & $H_a$: The mean number of units is more than 135,000 units per day. \\
    ~ \\
    C & $H_0$: The mean number of units is 135,000 units per day.  \\
      & $H_a$: The mean number of units is not 135,000 units per day. \\
    ~ \\
    D & $H_0$: The mean number of units is not 135,000 units per day.  \\
      & $H_a$: The mean number of units is 135,000 units per day.

  \end{tabular}

    \end{tabular}
    \\ Use a 5\% significance level.
  }

  \vfill

  \only<3->
  {

    Sample the daily output for twenty-five days chosen at random, and
    ask if there is sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$. Suppose we
    find a sample mean of 140,266 units per day and a standard
    deviation of 14,000 units per day.

  }

  \vfill

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result}

  We \textbf{do not} have sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ at the
  5\% significance level using a normal distribution with twenty-five
  samples and a standard deviation of 14,000 units per day.
