% To display a lecture replace the name in the "includeonly" line
% below to match the name of the file. For example, to display the
% file "introduction.tex" replace the "predictionIntervals" with
% "introduction"  You do not have to do anything with the lecture line
% below and can leave it commented out. It is in place because at one
% time we had multiple lectures within a file, but that has been
% changed.
