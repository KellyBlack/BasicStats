\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Grading}

  
  The final grades are calculated using the following distribution: 

  \vfill

    \begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
      60\% & Three Exams, \\
      17\% & Quizzes, \\
      17\% & Webworks, \\
      6\%  & Attendance/Clicker Response 
    \end{tabular}

    \vfill
  
    At the end of the semester we assign letter grades as follows:
    97\% for an A+, 93\% for an A, 90\% for an A-, 
    87\% for a  B+, 83\% for an B, 80\% for a B-, 
    77\% for a  C+, 73\% for an C, 70\% for a C-, 
    and \%60 for a D.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Exam Dates}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The first test is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, 10
    February 2015, at 07:00 PM in Science Center 360. 
  \item The second test is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, 12
    March 2015, at 07:00 PM in Science Center 360 . 
  \item The third test will take place during finals week at the time
    scheduled for the final exam. (There will not be a final exam.)
  \item You should bring your own pencils, blank paper, calculators,
    and good luck charms.  The professor will not have any spare
    materials.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Quizzes}

  There will be a quizzes most weeks in your recitation. The quizzes
  will be similar to the posted homework problems. There will be
  additional quizzes during lecture. Some will be announced in
  advance, and there will be unannounced quizzes during the lecture
  sessions.  Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Clickers}

  A portion of your grade is for classroom attendance and
  participation. This is measured using clickers. Each day one or more
  questions will be asked, and you will be asked to respond using the
  clicker. The clicker that we are using is from Turning Point
  Technologies, and we recommend that you use the ResponseCard RF LCD
  clicker. You can purchase the clicker at
  \url{https://store.turningtechnologies.com} The Clarkson University
  promotional code is Z0k0.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Clickers}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item We will start using the clickers Friday, 16 January 2015. Each
    day one or more questions will be asked.

  \item You need to register your clicker. You should have received an
    email with instructions on how to do this.

    \textbf{Note: Zero is not an ``O'' !!!}

  \item To register your clicker look for the \textit{Turning
      Technologies} block on the right hand side of our moodle course
    page.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Webwork}

  Webwork is a web based homework system. You can find
  it at the following URL: \\
  \url{http://black.sc.clarkson.edu/webwork2/}.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Academic Accommodations}

  If you require any kind of special accommodation please come see me.
  Requests for academic accommodations must be made during the first
  three weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances.
  Students must register with the Office of Accommodative Services,
  located in the Student Success Center, 110 ERC, to verify their
  eligibility for appropriate accommodations.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Office Hours}

  Prof. Black's office hours are the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item from 9am to 10:30am on Wednesdays, 
  \item from 9am to 10:30am on Fridays,
  \item from 10am to 11am on Mondays,
  \item from 9am to 11am on Tuesdays.
  \item Please contact Prof. Black to schedule other times to
    meet.

  Different kinds of data....

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Example Data Set}

  Fukushima Radiation Survey

  Measurements taken during the 11 march 2011 crisis after the
  T\={o}hoku earthquake:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Time
  \item Date
  \item Longitude
  \item Latitude
  \item Distance From Source
  \item Direction From Source
  \item Radiation Level (mRad/hour)
  \item Description
  \item several others
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Direction}

  \begin{tabular}{c}

\begin{frame}{Why is the data spread out?}

  Problem: The data has a random component. Different measurements at
  different times give different radiation levels. 

  \vfill

  There is spread in the data and there are probabilities associated
  with how likely you are to get a certain range of measurements.

  \vfill
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability}

  What is probability?

  \begin{definition}[Probability]
    ``\textbf{Probability} is the measure of the likelihood of a random
    phenomena or chance behavior. Probability describes the long-term
    proportion with which a certain \textbf{outcome} will occur in
    situations with short-term uncertainty.'' (Page 223)
  \end{definition}

  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example}

  Everybody flip a coin once.

  \uncover<2->%
  {

    What did you get?

  }

  \uncover<3->%
  {

    Do it again!

  }

  \uncover<4->%
  {

    What did you get?

  }

  \uncover<5->%
  {

    Do it again!

  }

  \uncover<6->%
  {

    What did you get?

  }


  \uncover<7->%
  {

    (Four people) Flip a coin

  }

  \uncover<8->%
  {

    What did you get?

  }

  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What the heck are we doing?}

  \begin{description}
  \item[Event:] Something that \textit{can} happen.
  \item[Outcome:] Something that did happen.
  \item[Experiment:] A structured activity that includes the
    measurement of the outcomes of the activity after predefined and
    intentional changes to some aspect of the events.
  \item[Observational Study:] A structured activity that includes the
    measurement of the outcomes of the activity without intentional
    changes to the events.
  \item[Expected Outcome:] The ``average'' of the possible outcomes.
  \item[Variation:] Some measure of the spread of possible outcomes.
  \end{description}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability vs. Statistics}

  ``Probability'' is an idealized notion. If we repeat the experiment
  an infinite number of times we ask what \textit{will} happen.

  \vfill

  ``Statistics'' is the study of how to interpret data. We ask what
  ``did'' happen and what does it imply about the underlying
  probabilities?

  \vfill

  \uncover<2->%
  {

    Problem: We need to have a basic understanding of probability
    before we can do statistics.
