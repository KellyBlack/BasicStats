  You want to monitor the travel costs for sales people in remote
  offices. It is estimated that the mean travel cost per person is
  \$5,500 per person per month with a standard deviation of
  \$1,200. Each week you will sample fifteen sales people at random
  and calculate a sample mean.

  \vfill

  What is the upper control limit using a $3\sigma$ cut-off?

  \begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{3em}}l@{\hspace{3em}}l}
    A: \$5,809.80 & B: \$6430.50 & C: \$6,700.00

  You are monitoring the travel costs for sales people in remote
  offices. It was estimated that the mean travel cost per person is
  \$5,500 per person per month with a standard deviation of \$1,200.
  Each week you sample fifteen sales people at random and calculate a
  sample mean. Due to increased fuel costs you suspect that the mean
  has shifted to be \$5,750. 

  \vfill

  What is the probability that this increase will be detected?

  You want to monitor the travel costs for sales people in remote
  offices. It is estimated that the travel costs per person is
  normally distributed with a mean of \$5,500 per person per month
  with a standard deviation of \$1,200. Each week you will sample
  fifty sales people at random. You will then determine the proportion
  of people whose costs are above \$5,800.
