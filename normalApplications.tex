  The temperature measurements of a heat sink is normally distributed
  with mean 112F and standard deviation 14F. What is the probability
  that a measurement will be between 47C and 55C?

  \frametitle{Example}

  The mass of glass jars are normally distributed with a mean of
  0.25kg and a standard deviation of 0.03kg. The total mass of the
  packaged product is normally distributed with a mean of 0.35kg and a
  standard deviation of 0.08kg. What is the distribution associated
  with the contents of the jars? (Assume that the mass of the jar and
  its contents are independent.)

    The mean starting salaries for business majors is \$56,000 with a
    standard deviation of \$5,000. What is the probability that a
    randomly chosen business major will have an offer of more than
    \$63,000 per year?

    The total change in a stock's price on one particular day has a
    mean of -.35\$ with a standard deviation of .86\$.  What is the
    probability that the price change in a randomly chosen stock will
    be more than zero?

  \frametitle{Example}

  The width of glass panes is normally distributed with a mean of
  1.20cm and a standard deviation of 0.08cm. What mean width and
  standard deviation should be designed for the groove in the frames
  so that the gap is normally distributed with a mean of 0.15cm and a
  standard deviation of 0.12cm?

  \frametitle{Example}

  The voltage across a resistor is normally distributed with mean 18V
  and standard deviation 1.2V. Two measurements are taken and
  averaged. What is the probability that the average is more than
  18.5V? (Assume that the measurements are independent.)

\begin{frame}{Example}

  Some bolts are to be designed so that their breaking strength is
  normally distributed with mean 80N. Three samples are taken. What
  should the standard deviation be so that the probability that the
  average breaking strength of the samples is less than 78N is 0.05?

  (Assume that the samples are independent.)

  A random variable, $X$, is normally distributed with mean 3.5 and
  standard deviation 1.2. Determine the following probabilities:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    p(X\geq 3.2), \\
    p(X \leq 4.7), \\
    p(3.1\leq X \leq 5.2), \\
    p(|X-3|\leq 1.1), \\
    p(|X-2.5|\geq 2.1).
  \end{eqnarray*}

\begin{frame}{Example}

  A cylinder and piston is to be constructed so that the diameter of
  the cylinder is normally distributed with mean 4.50 cm and a
  standard deviation of 0.02cm. The bore should be designed so that
  the gap is normally distributed with a mean of 0.10cm and a standard
  deviation of 0.04cm. What is the required distribution for the bore?

  A random variable is normally distributed with mean 0.05 and
  standard deviation 0.35. It is sampled four times (assume
  independence between samples), and the sample mean, $Y$, is
  calculated. What is the probability that the sample mean of the four
  samples is more than 0.10 from the mean of $Y$?

\begin{frame}
  A random variable is normally distributed with mean 0.05 and
  standard deviation 0.35. It is sampled five times (assume
  independence between samples), and the sample mean, $Y$, is
  calculated. What is the probability that the sample mean of the five
  samples is more than 0.10 from the mean of $Y$?
